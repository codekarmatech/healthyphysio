use DRY concept,never change naming coventions , all ways make code as per best practices, check exsiting funcationality and check we its best practice and approach for situationto remak it or edit ormake seprate thing ,
do not assume , check files in all folders sometimes files can be set to wrong path before creating new files,
we dont make MVP models so not temp code but full funcational life time solution code.
Not short time fix but parmenant fix , 
always find root cause and solve it
make sure to use all the define imports
never delete eslint warning check if the funcationality needed,if neededdoest it ,if it does implement it
we are using tailwind css in healthyphsio project, any contect of mui remove it

never do : eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
