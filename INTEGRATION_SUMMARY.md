# Therapist Dashboard Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to properly integrate the Therapist Dashboard with the backend API, specifically focusing on removing mock data and implementing real API endpoints.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Created Earnings App

- Created models, serializers, views, and URLs for the earnings app
- Implemented API endpoints for retrieving earnings data
- Added signal handlers to automatically create earnings records from appointments
- Created management commands for generating sample data

### 2. API Endpoints Implemented

- `/api/earnings/monthly/{therapist_id}/?year={year}&month={month}` - Get monthly earnings for a therapist
- Additional endpoints for earnings analytics and summaries

### 3. Sample Data for New Therapists

- Implemented a mechanism to provide sample data for new therapists who don't have real earnings yet
- This ensures that new therapists can see how the dashboard will look once they start seeing patients

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Updated API Service Calls

- Modified `earningsService.js` to use real API endpoints instead of mock data
- Kept mock data generation functions for reference but marked them as deprecated

### 2. Updated Dashboard Components

- Updated `TherapistDashboard.jsx` to use the real API endpoints
- Improved error handling for API calls
- Added support for displaying sample data for new therapists

### 3. Updated Earnings Pages

- Updated `EarningsPage.jsx` and `TherapistEarningsPage.jsx` to use real API endpoints
- Improved error handling and loading states

## Integration Approach

### Real Data First, Sample Data as Fallback

The integration follows a "real data first" approach:

1. Always attempt to fetch real data from the API
2. For new therapists with no appointments yet, the backend provides sample data
3. Clear error messages are shown if data cannot be retrieved

### Automatic Data Generation

Earnings records are automatically created when:
- An appointment is marked as completed
- An appointment is cancelled (with or without a cancellation fee)

This ensures that the earnings data is always up-to-date with the latest appointment status.

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Create therapists and patients in the system
2. Schedule and complete appointments
3. Verify that earnings records are created
4. Check the Therapist Dashboard to ensure earnings data is displayed correctly

For generating test data:

```bash
python manage.py generate_earnings --therapist_id=1 --month=5 --year=2023 --count=10
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more detailed analytics for earnings data
2. Implement filtering and sorting options for earnings records
3. Add export functionality for earnings reports
4. Implement payment tracking and integration with payment processors
