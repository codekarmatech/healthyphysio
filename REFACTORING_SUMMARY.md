# Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to eliminate duplicate code and improve the maintainability of the HealthyPhysio application. The refactoring focused on the frontend services layer, which had significant code duplication.

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized API Configuration

- Created a single source of truth for API communication in `api.js`
- Implemented robust error handling and token refresh functionality
- Removed duplicate API instance creation from `authService.js`
- Added response interceptors to handle common error scenarios

### 2. Created a Base Service Class

- Implemented `BaseService` class with common CRUD operations
- All service classes now extend this base class
- Reduced duplicate code for common operations like:
  - Getting all resources
  - Getting a resource by ID
  - Creating resources
  - Updating resources
  - Deleting resources
  - Filtering resources by field values
  - Performing custom actions on resources

### 3. Extracted Common Utilities

- Created reusable date utility functions in `utils.js`
- Extracted mock data generation logic into `mockDataUtils.js`
- Centralized authentication logic

### 4. Standardized Service Implementation

- Converted all service objects to classes that extend `BaseService`
- Implemented consistent method naming and parameter ordering
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for better code documentation
- Created singleton instances for all services

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

- Implemented consistent error handling across all services
- Added token refresh mechanism for expired tokens
- Improved error logging and user feedback

## Files Modified

1. `api.js` - Enhanced with robust error handling and token refresh
2. `utils.js` - Added date utilities and removed duplicate auth logic
3. `appointmentService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
4. `patientService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
5. `therapistService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
6. `assessmentService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
7. `sessionService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
8. `attendanceService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
9. `rescheduleRequestService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
10. `earningsService.js` - Refactored to use BaseService
11. `authService.js` - Refactored to use the centralized API instance

## Files Created

1. `baseService.js` - Base class for all services
2. `mockDataUtils.js` - Utilities for generating mock data

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated hundreds of lines of duplicate code
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality only need to be made in one place
3. **Better Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all services
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments for better code documentation
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly
6. **Simplified Testing**: Common functionality can be tested once
7. **Consistent API**: All services now follow the same patterns and conventions

## Future Improvements

1. Implement unit tests for the base service and utilities
2. Create a more robust error handling system with user-friendly error messages
3. Add TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
4. Implement a more sophisticated caching mechanism for API responses
5. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
